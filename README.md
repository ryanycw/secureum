#### Scoring System (Classmarker)

1. If a Q has a single option as the correct answer then choosing anything other/more than that gives 0 points. For e.g., If a question has correct answer as B, and BC were entered, will he get 1/2 marks? — will get 0 and so will choosing anything other/more than B. This is presumably to prevent rewarding supersets of answers i.e. one can lazily choose ABCD as options.
2. If a Q has more than one option, say n options, as the correct answer then the platform allows only choosing up to n options and the partial points rewarded = #chosen-correct-options/n. For e.g., if a question has correct answers as AB, and the person chose ABD, will he get 2/3 marks? — this is not allowed because only 2 options are allowed to be chosen; If a question has correct answers as BC, and B was entered, will he get 1/2 marks? — will get 1/2.
